# Leetcode 339. Nested List Weight Sum

You are given a nested list of integers nestedList. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

The depth of an integer is the number of lists that it is inside of. For example, the nested list [1,[2,2],[[3],2],1] has each integer's value set to its depth.

Return the sum of each integer in nestedList multiplied by its depth.

## Recursion or stack
If the problem gives a class to hold the nested list, can use recursion.

If it is represented by a string. When see a [, depth+1, all numbers after it has the corresponding depth. When see a ], depth-1.
